Run Gentoo amd64?  Interested in a 32bit userland for it?  Willing to deal
with failures and fix them?  This is for you!

This is an overlay and a profile for 32bit userland on 64bit Gentoo.  It's hard to use.

First, the profile needs to be copied over portage after every sync; for some
reason, profiles in overlays don't work.

Second, you need a proper state to bootstrap from.  Normal 64bit didn't work
when I tried it (although sparc has since done this; I intend to find out how,
when I get a chance).  I haven't yet put my stage up, but it can be made with
catalyst and some experimentation.

Third, you need this overlay, plus some other workarounds (which will make it
into the overlay over time).

Fourth, you need a full 64bit chroot for making binpkgs of certain things that
must be multlib (such as gcc, glibc, and sandbox) and for building your kernel
(the kernel build system is too smart for it's own good).

Fifth, you need a willingness to deal with frustration. :P

That said, this *does* work and I *am* running it on several real systems and
number of VMs.  Good luck, and let me know (dang@gentoo.org) if you use it, or
have suggestions.

UPDATE:

I'm working on using i686-pc-linux-gnu as the CHOST, rather than x86_64; when
doing this, you need to build your kernel using:

make ARCH=x86

Make sure to select a 64bit kernel and enable 32bit emulation.  This should
hopefully remove the need for all the packages in this overlay entirely.



UPDATE2:

You don't want this; you want the i686 branch
