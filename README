Run Gentoo amd64?  Interested in a 32bit userland for it?  Willing to deal
with failures and fix them?  This is for you!

This is an overlay and a profile for 32bit userland on 64bit Gentoo.  It's hard to use.

This branch is for using i686 as your CHOST.  It is important that you set
CHOST propery in your profile to use this branch.

Boot an amd64 boot CD, and install an i686 stage3.  Set up this overlay, and
copy this profile over your portage, and pick the 32bit-userland profile.

Patch your toolchain.eclass

Copy 64bit libc from your amd64 box  into /lib64 and /usr/lib64.  You'll need /lib64/libc.* /usr/lib64/libc.*.

From CD, mv /lib -> /lib32 and symlink /lib32 lib (and for /usr/lib)

Copy /etc/env/04multilib to the chroot and remove /lib:/usr/lib:

Emerge a multilib gcc.

Emerge a multilib glibc.

emerge -e world

You will now have a /lib and a /lib32.  Anything left in /lib, move it to
/lib32, and symlink.  Ditto /usr/lib[32].  Make sure to *not* overwrite
anything already in lib32.  I used cp -avi.

emerge -e world again.

Continue installing your system like normal.  When you build a kernel, you need
to make it with:

make ARCH=x86

Make sure to select a 64bit kernel and enable 32bit emulation.
